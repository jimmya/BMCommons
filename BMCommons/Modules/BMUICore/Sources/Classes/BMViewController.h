/**
 Base class for view controllers.
 
 This class ensures that viewDidLoad is always followed eventually by viewDidUnload (called from dealloc if needed) so the objects allocated or retained in viewDidLoad can be symmetrically released in viewDidUnload. It also handles didReceiveMemoryWarning in a backwards compatible way (calling viewDidUnload if needed).
 Other functionality includes BMStyleSheet support which if attached (see property styleSheet) is pushed on the stack of stylesheets together with this view controller.
 
 The viewState property tracks the view state of this view controller (BMViewStateInvisible, BMViewStateToBecomeVisible, BMViewStateVisible, BMViewStateToBecomeInvisible).
 
 This class also posts a BMViewControllerWillAppearNotification notification on viewWillAppear and keeps track with the property firstAppearAfterLoad and firstLoad of the loading state of the view.
 
 The viewFactory property contains a reference to a BMViewFactory which may be used to create reusable views. The methods keyboardDidShow: and keyboardWillHide: can be overridden by subclasses if they want to be notified of keyboard appearance/hiding.
