/**
 Class that manages the execution of services and acts as a registry for delegates that listen to service events.
 
 Although possible to execute BMService instances directly (using [BMService execute]) using this class is the prefered way of executing services.
 Use performService:withDelegate: to execute any service and register it with this instance.

 This class is thread safe. Be sure to implement the BMServiceManagerDelegate also in a thread safe manner, because the methods on that protocol may be called from a background thread.

 All the BMServiceDelegate methods will by default be called on the main thread except when a delegate queue has been set explicitly.
